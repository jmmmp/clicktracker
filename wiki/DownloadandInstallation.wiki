=How to install and run the Click Tracker patch=
==1 - Install Pure Data Extended==
The software runs with Pure Data-Extended (Pd for short), which you must install first. Pure Data is a free software for live electronics. Installing it on your computer should be an easy process, just do the following:

 * go to the <a href="http://puredata.info/downloads">download Pd</a> section on the Pd website (left corner)
 * choose Pd-Extended
 * download the release of Pd-Extended that fits your system
 * install the program and start it, the window “Pd-extended” will appear
 * go to the menu Media -> "Test Audio and MIDI"
 * in the new window, on the left side under "TEST TONES", try clicking on the values “80” or “60” (volume values in decibels). You should hear a sine tone at 440 Hz (A).
 * if this happened, everything is ok. If not, maybe you need to setup your audio (Media -> Audio settings), or there is another problem.

If you have difficulties getting Pd to work, feel free to contact me — I'll try to help as much as I can.
 
==2 - Open and Run the Click Tracker Patch==

Once you have Pd installed and running, you can open the zip file with the patch:
 * unpack the file to a new folder
 * within Pd open up the file named *click-tracker.pd*
 * there you have the Click tracker. Click "Open score" (or press the key "o") to open a score
 * open up the file *examples/score-tutorial.txt* that is in the folder of the patch
 * click Play (or press space) to start hearing the score.
 
And that's it. If you click on the Instructions button you'll find a short explanation of the patch. But to get more detailed informations, and to know how to start a new score, you should open *score-tutorial.txt* with a text editor. This file isn't only a score, but also a full tutorial explaining how the program works.

Alternatively, look up the same tutorial [http://code.google.com/p/clicktracker/wiki/ClickTrackerTutorial online].

After you went through it, you can also see other score examples that I put in the same folder: excerpts by Stravinsky, Boulez and Nunes.
