<p><strong>Click Tracker</strong> is a program designed for composers, conductors and instrumentalists working with modern music. The main goal of the software is to prepare a click track of any score, no matter how complex it is. It can also be used as a programmable metronome.</p>
<center><img src="images/click-tracker-max-win.png"></center>
<p>This software runs in Windows, macOS and Linux, and can be used either by conductors in concert, by musicians for practice purposes, or by composers while composing.</p>
<p>To prepare a score, just input the values in a plain text file format (.txt) according to the syntax explained in the tutorial online, or sent with the program.</p>
<p>The <strong>Click Tracker App</strong> is now available &ndash; check the <a href="http://jmmmp.github.io/clicktracker/index-mob.html" target="_blank">app website</a> for it.</p>

<p>In order to make its development possible, a <strong>one-time donation</strong> is suggested. For professional musicians I would suggest 50 EUR, for students 25 EUR &ndash; of course, you can donate more or less than that. Keep in mind that if you use this program regularly, it will save much rehearsal and learning time. And also, for the program to reach this stage of development, many hours of work were invested into it.<br>
Donations can be easily made through <a href="https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/jmmmp/50">PAYPAL</a>. Bank transfers to a german account are also possible (<a href="mailto:clicktracker@posteo.org?subject=Click%20Tracker%20Donation">contact me</a> for details).<br>
An invoice can be written for donations.</p>

<a id="testimonials" class="anchor" href="#testimonials" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Users and testimonials</h2>
<p>The Click Tracker is used by instrumentalists, conductors and composers such as: Anna D'Errico, Carl Ludwig Hübsch, Carola Bauckholt, Haakon Stene, Matteo Cesari, Pavlos Antoniadis, Stefan Prins, Jack Quartet, and the ensembles Asamisimasa, Nadar, Interface, loadbang and Schlagquartett Köln.<br>
This is what some users have to say about the software:</p>
<blockquote>The Click Tracker is an essential tool for the new generation of musicians. It allows the cautious interpreter to master the intricacy of time structures at ease.</blockquote>
<qauthor><a href="http://www.matteocesari.com/" target="_blank">Matteo Cesari</a>&ensp;flutist</qauthor>
<p><br></p>
<blockquote>As an interpreter of new music, I am sometimes faced with challenges that deal with extremely complex tempo relations. Some of the foremost composers of our time, like Brian Ferneyhough, Enno Poppe and others, have been incorporating this challenge as a powerful expressive means in their aesthetics. I have been using the Click Tracker in order to refine my performance in works that require this kind of virtuosity.<br>
I would definitely recommend it: its friendly and simple interface allows a performer to set up by himself/herself immediate support tools for challenges that are nothing but "friendly and simple"!</blockquote>
<qauthor><a href="http://www.annaderrico.com/" target="_blank">Anna D’Errico</a>&ensp;pianist</qauthor>
<p><br></p>
<blockquote>Excellent tool for learning and performing regardless of score complexity. Very easy to learn itself!</blockquote>
<qauthor><a href="https://pavlosantoniadis.wordpress.com/about/" target="_blank">Pavlos Antoniadis</a>&ensp;pianist</qauthor>
<p><br></p>
<blockquote>With the Click Tracker João Pais offers a highly flexible and long-awaited tool for musicians who require a metronome that meets the multiple work specific demands of contemporary music: combining complex metrical structures, customized sub-divisions, tempo changes, as well as a wide range of other features, all easily and quickly programmed. The Click Tracker fills in the gap between standard mechanical metronome functions and a conductor's flexibility, and is useful in rehearsal as well as in performance.</blockquote>
<qauthor><a href="http://www.hakonstene.net/" target="_blank">Håkon Stene</a>&ensp; percussionist</qauthor>
<p><br></p>
<blockquote>Working with Click Tracker is like working on your fundamentals in sports. Your body needs to absorb it. Thanks for your program!</blockquote>
<qauthor><a href="http://www.nadarensemble.be/" target="_blank">Pieter Matthynssens</a>&ensp;cellist</qauthor>
<p><br></p>
<blockquote>As the director of the vocal ensemble Ekmeles and artistic director of ensemble loadbang I am constantly leading rehearsals on new and difficult music. For scores with complex metric and tempo changes, Click Tracker allows for the kind of focused work on rhythm which would be impossible with a traditional metronome. Making click tracks is extraordinarily easy and intuitive, even for the most complicated scores.</blockquote>
<qauthor><a href="http://jeffreygavett.com/" target="_blank">Jeff Gavett</a>&ensp;baritone, conductor, composer</qauthor>
<p><br></p>
<blockquote>The Click Tracker is extremely easy to use, in 30 minutes you can grasp the nuts and bolts and are able to make a click track! I have used it multiple times, both for rehearsals (the rehearsal mode, starting at whatever measure, and giving the option to change the tempo when necessary is super convenient) and for making click tracks for concerts.<br>Since I got to know João and this awesome program I haven't used anything else when dealing with click tracks!</blockquote>

<h4>How to install and run the Click Tracker patch</h4>
<p><strong>1 &ndash; Install and test Pure Data</strong><br>
The software runs with Pure Data (Pd for short), which you must install first. Pure Data is a free software for live electronics. Follow these steps to install and test the software:<br>
<ul>
<li>download the <strong>64 bit release</strong> of <a href="http://puredata.info/downloads/pure-data" target="_blank">Pure Data</a>.</li>
<li>install the program and start it, the window “Pd” will appear</li>
<li>go to the menu Media -> "Test Audio and MIDI"</li>
<li>on the left side under "TEST TONES", try clicking on the values “80” or “60” (volume values in decibels). You should hear a sine tone at 440 Hz (A).</li>
<li>if this happened, everything is ok. If not, maybe you need to setup your audio (Media -> Audio settings), or there is another problem.</li>
</ul>
If you have difficulties getting Pd to work, feel free to <a href="mailto:clicktracker@posteo.org?subject=Click%20Tracker%20Pd%20help">contact me</a> &ndash; I'll try to help as much as I can.<br>
For macOS Catalina users: due to the new Apple restrictions, it might be necessary to right-click to start the Pd application.</p>
<p><strong>2 &ndash; Open and Run the Click Tracker Patch</strong><br>
Once you have Pd installed and running, you can open the zip file with the patch:<br>
<ul>
<li>unpack the file to a new folder</li>
<li>within Pd open up the file named <strong>click-tracker.pd</strong></li>
<li>there you have the Click tracker. Click "Open score" (or press the key "o") to open a score</li>
<li>open up the file <strong>examples/_score-tutorial.txt</strong> that is in the folder of the patch</li>
<li>click Play (or press space) to start hearing the score.</li>
</ul>
And that's it. If you click on the Instructions button you'll find a short explanation of the patch. But to get more detailed informations, and to know how to start a new score, you should open <strong>_score-tutorial.txt</strong> with a text editor. This file isn't only a score, but also a full tutorial explaining how the program works.<br>
Alternatively, look up the same tutorial <a href="#tutorial">below</a>.<br>
In the same folder you can find other score excerpts by Stravinsky, Boulez, Stockhausen, Lang and Nunes.</p>
-->

<h2>
<a id="tutorial" class="anchor" href="#tutorial" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Tutorial</h2>
<p>This tutorial shows how to prepare a score for the Click Tracker patch, including all its features.<br>
The Click Tracker reads documents in text format (.txt). They must be saved as text-only &ndash; in case you use Word or any other office software you should pay attention to this.<br>I suggest using a programme such as <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a> for Windows or <a href="https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/">BBEdit</a> for Apple to edit your track files. See <a href="#syntax-high">below</a> for other resources for these programs.<br>
To reproduce a piece with the Click Tracker you must transcribe the score you want to hear to the format readable by this program &ndash; basically you must write down the metrical structure of the score.<br>
The score below will be coded in the tutorial. You can find it under <strong>examples/_score-tutorial.txt</strong>.</p>
<center><img src="images/score-tutorial-v3.png"></center>

<h4>ADDING TEMPO / BARS</h4>
<p>You start the score by writing a tempo with the command "t 60" (with space in between) for MM=60  &ndash;  in case you forget to say which tempo you want the program will assume that the piece is at MM60.<p>
A regular bar can be added with the command x/y &ndash; like a normal bar. For example with only a couple lines we can create a simple bar sequence. Bars 2-5 go from 4/4 to 1/4:</p>
<pre><code>t 60
4/4
4/4
3/4
2/4
1/4</code></pre>
<center><img src="images/score-tutorial-1.png" width="689" height="95"></center>
<p>But you can use any ratio you want to: for the x/y format, it's only important that the numerator is a whole number (no decimal numbers allowed). On the other hand the denominator can be decimal if you want to. For example bars 6-7:</p>
<pre><code>4/6
5/8.5</code></pre>
<center><img src="images/score-tutorial-2.png" width="399" height="88"></center>

<h4>COMPOSITE TIME SIGNATURES</h4>
You can add composite time signatures using the syntax x+y/z. You can use as many segments as necessary:
<pre><code>2+3/8
2+3+3/8</code></pre>
<center><img src="images/score-tutorial-2a.png" width="319" height="67"></center>
Although it's not explicitly exemplified, you can use any of the previous numerators.

<h4>ADDING BEATS</h4>
To notate events in higher detail, you can define the duration of each beat in one line &ndash; for example 1 for a full beat. There are 2 possible parameters: the beat duration and the letter "b" to mark the beginning of a bar (separated by a space).<br>
For example here is a 4/4 bar:</p>
<pre><code>1 b
1
1
1
</code></pre>
<center><img src="images/score-tutorial-3.png" width="150" height="68"></center>
<p>The same result is attained with both x/y syntax or with discrete events. These two 5/8 bars are written out differently, but sound the same:</p>
<pre><code>5/8
.5 b
.5
.5
.5
.5</code></pre>
<p>If you need a bar with irregular divisions, you'll need to define different durations:</p>
<pre><code>1.5 b  
1</code></pre>
<center><img src="images/score-tutorial-4.png" width="476" height="69"></center>
<p>Also the y number always understands the 4th-note to be the standard duration. In case you're writing a score where another value is the base value for the tempo (for example 8th-note or minim) then you must do some math to get the proportions right. Always think of the beats as individual durations one after the other.</p>
<p>Notice that all decimal values must be written with a dot instead of a comma.<br>
There is another way to notate factional values &ndash; through the fraction that calculates the value. You can use any values on both sides of the fraction. Here follow some values notated in both ways:</p>
<pre><code>0.5 b
1:2
0.666
2:3
0.928
6.5:7</code></pre>
<center><img src="images/score-tutorial-5.png" width="255" height="93"></center>
<p>And now something completely different: a completely irregular bar with some irrational values.</p>
<pre><code>1 b
.2
1.65465439458675
5.14</code></pre>
<center><img src="images/score-tutorial-6.png" width="306" height="85"></center>

<h4>USER-DEFINED METRIC SUBDIVISIONS</h4>
<p>With the letter "s" after an event, you can make a third type of metric subdivision sound, between the pitches of the first and other beats in the bar. Use it as you use the "b" letter; this must come always after the first event in a bar.</p>
<pre><code>1 b
1
1 s
1

.5 b
.5
.5
.5 s
.5
.5
.5 s
.5 

.5 b
.5
.5 s
.5
.5 s
.5
.5 s
.5</code></pre>
<center><img src="images/score-tutorial-11.png"></center>
<p>You might notice that a beat with a subdivision have an extra "s" in the beat number GUI. Also, see below in the GUI Control and Command List sections how to use the "subdiv" command or the GUI to switch the playback of subdivisions on/off.</p>


<h4>CHANGING TEMPI</h4>
<p>
You can use the t command anywhere in the piece and how many times you want &ndash; just put it before the note you want it to apply for. For example here is a bar where the tempo changes on each note:</p>
<pre><code>t 60
1 b
t 120
1
t 30
1
t 90
1</code></pre>
<p>If your time signature is irregular you can change the duration of each beat &ndash; including with decimal values. Bar 16 sounds just like the previous one but in the same tempo throughout:</p>
<pre><code>t 60
1 b
.5
2
.666</code></pre>
<center><img src="images/score-tutorial-7.png" width="429" height="91"></center>
<p>There are no limits for the decimal values you can use. Any value (as long as written correctly) can be played back.</p>

<h4>ADDING COMMENTS</h4>
<p>As you might have noticed by now this file is at the same time the tutorial for the program and also a score that can be performed. The parts with the numbers are the "music" and comments can be made in any place in the file if you put the "# " (a hash and a space) before each comment.<br>
Very important about the comments: you can't use any commas or semicolons &ndash; it would be misinterpreted by the program!<br>
I suggest to use comments to mark the bars / systems / pages in your track file. It will be helpful when editing it later.<br>
Also you don't have to layout all you music lines one after the other. They can have empty lines between them &ndash; as well as comments in the same line:<br>
<pre><code>1 b </code></pre>
<p>Here is the beginning of the bar &ndash; the letter b is after the beat duration.<br>
Here is an empty space. You can have as many as you want.</p>
<pre><code>

1
</code></pre>
<p>And some more beats</p>
<pre><code>1

1</code></pre>

<h4>GRADUAL TEMPO CHANGES and VOLUME CHANGES</h4>
<p>To change the tempo suddenly you already saw the t command. But to create gradual tempo changes &ndash; accelerandi and ritardandi &ndash; you can use the command "tc x y" where x is the new tempo and y the number of beats necessary to reach it. The beat duration of the tempo change MUST coincide with the sum of the beats it lasts: for example, if it lasts 1+1+0.75 beats, the result is 2.75.<br>
The "vol x" command scales the loudness of the click so that it fits with the musical content. Values between 0 and 10 are accepted. The scaling is independent of the main output's volume level. If no value is given the score sets to 10.<br>
Here is an accelerando with 1 bar duration and one bar in the new tempo. At the same time the volume goes slightly down.</p>
<pre><code>tc 120 4
vol 7
4/4</code></pre>
<p>and now we're in the new tempo. The volume goes lower.</p>
<pre><code>vol 4
4/4</code></pre>
<p>And now it slows down to slower as the initial tempo:</p>
<pre><code>tc 50 4
4/4</code></pre>
<p>and now is at MM50. The volume goes up on each beat until it gets back to the maximum.</p>
<pre><code>vol 5
1 b
vol 7
1
vol 8
1
vol 100
1</code></pre>
<center><img src="images/score-tutorial-8.png" width="573" height="103"></center>

<h4>REPETITIONS</h4>
<p>Repetitions of the same bar can be used a lot in modern music. In case you want to repeat a fragment just use the command "rep x y" where x is the number of beats you want to repeat and y the number of times. Put this command just before the first beat of the passage to be repeated. Again &ndash; x MUST coincide with the actual sum of beats (you can't use 1 as a value for y). The number of the current repetition will be shown in the screen.<br>
In case you use the "Go to bar" feature (more about that later) to start in the middle of a repetition sequence it won't work. For a repetition sequence to be correctly performed you must play the first note (since the command is before it).<br>
Here is a new irregular bar back at MM60:</p>
<pre><code>t 60
1 b
1
.5</code></pre>
<p>And now the same bar repeated 3 times:</p>
<pre><code>rep 2.5 3
1 b
1
.5</code></pre>
<p>You can also do the repetitions across the barlines. We stay in the same time signature but dislocate the repetition point:</p>
<pre><code>1 b
1
rep 2.5 4
.5
1 b
1
.5</code></pre>
<center><img src="images/score-tutorial-9.png" width="493" height="82"></center>

<h4>CUES</h4>
<p>Cues (see below) can be added using the syntax "cue x" - where x is the cue number.</p>
<pre><code>cue 1
1 b
1
.5</code></pre>

<p>Place the cue before any beat you want to mark. See further details below.</p>
<pre><code>1 b
cue 2
1
.5</code></pre>
<center><img src="images/score-tutorial-10.png" width="238" height="64"></center>

<h4>PICKUP BAR</h4>
<p>In a performance you can't start the click track without warning &ndash; with the "pickup x" comand it is possible to repeat the first bar as many times as you need in order for the musicians to prepare themselves. The parameter x defines how many times the bar will be repeated.<br>
You can either include this command in the score file (anywhere in the score but I suggest you to leave it on top) &ndash; or change it anytime in the patch itself. To have 1 pickup bar write "pickup 1".<br>
As pickup bars aren't exactly repetitions and you must know exactly when the piece is going to start the bar numbers in pickup bars work downwards until they get to 1 &ndash; which is point where the score begins. In case you have 1 pickup bar you'll and your chosen output has voice included you'll hear bar "2 [beats] 1". If you have 2 pickup bars then "3 [beats] 2 [beats] 1".</p>

<h4>OTHER FIRST BAR NUMBER</h4>
<p>With the comand "first x" you can define the number of the first bar to be played &ndash; in case your click track doesn't begin at bar 1.</p>

<h4>BEAT COUNTING DIRECTION</h4>
(Settings window)
<p>With the command "direction up" or "direction down" you can define if the beats inside a bar are counted upwards or downwards. If no command is used the standard value is "up". This can be set anytime in the patch using the button "beat.dir".</p>

<h4>BAR FILTER</h4>
(Settings window)
<p>Use the buttons under "Bar Filter" to define how many bars are spoken: all / every 5 bars / every 10 bars. This can be helpful in very dense tracks.<br>
You can also define the setting in your score using the command "bar-filt x" and the number 0 / 1 / 2 for the settings mentioned above:
<pre><code>bar-filt 0</code></pre>
</p>

<h4>CUES</h4>
<p>You can prepare your own audio cues to be added to the click track. These must follow the following conventions:<br>
<ul>
<li>store them in the same folder as the score file &ndash; see the examples folder.</li>
<li>format them as mono / wav / 16b / 44.1KHz</li>
<li>name them as whole numbers starting from 1: 1.wav / 2.wav / 3.wav / etc.</li>
<li>use the same name to add them to the score: "cue 1" / "cue 2" / "cue 3" / etc.</li>
</ul>
As long as all previous conditions are met you can use any audio content in your cue files. If a cue isn't found you'll see an error message such as "cue1.wav not found".
</p>

<h4>DEFINITION OF PLAYBACK PARAMETERS</h4>
<p>You can adjust the playback parameters click format and language anytime while working with the patch. But you can also adjust them in the score file. Then you don't need to always reset your patch when you load a new score (assuming each score has a different setting). To set a parameter you just write the command "par [parameters]" anywhere in the score. But like with the pickup command I advise you to put these general remarks in the beginning. Note: if you write down more than one command for the same parameter then the last command is the one to be valid.<br>
The available parameters are:<br>
click format &ndash; click / voice + click  =  cl clst<br>
language &ndash; english / german / spanish /portuguese  =  english deutsch espanol portugues<br>
For example to have a click track performed with clicks you write</p>
<pre><code>par cl</code></pre>
<p>To have a score performed with click and voice in portuguese you write</p>
<pre><code>par clst portugues</code></pre>
<p>The standard format is voice + click / english. Since there were some other commands before let's set it back to the standard preset.</p>
<pre><code>par clst english</code></pre>

<h3>GUI CONTROL</h3>
The Click Tracker's GUI offers the following possibilities (keyboard shortcuts are between [ ] ): <br>
<strong>Play / Stop [Space]</strong> &ndash; Self-explanatory.<br>
<strong>Continue playing [p]</strong> &ndash; Plays from the beginning of the bar where playback stopped the last time.<br>
<strong>Open score / reload score</strong> &ndash; Open a score file or reload one (in case the file was edited).<br>
<strong>Export WAV</strong> &ndash; Exports an audio file of the score (without a playback).<br>
<strong>Export MIDI</strong> &ndash; Exports a midi file of the score (see <a href="#midiexport">below</a href> for more details).<br>
<strong>Record</strong> &ndash; Play the score and record it at the same time.<br>
<strong>Set file</strong> &ndash; Before you record a click track say where it's going to be recorded and with which name. In case you forget this the program will record it with the same name and place as the score file. You only have to write the name of the file. The termination .wav will be added by the program.<br>

<h2>
<a id="library" class="anchor" href="#library" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Click Tracker Library</h2>
<p>A public library of Click Tracker files is being built &ndash; you can find it <a href="http://jmmmp.github.io/clicktracker/index-library" target="_blank">here</a>. You can download any tracks that were submitted to it, or also find out how you can support the library yourself.</p>


<h2>
<a id="midiexport" class="anchor" href="#midiexport" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>MIDI Export</h2>
<p>Exported MIDI files are formated in this way:
<ul>
<li>Pitches 72 and 60 (C5 and C4) play the first and other beats in the bar.</li>
<li>A tag is added to each bar with the current time, repetition indicator ("bar number"."repetition number"), and the text "bar X".</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>There are certain limitations:
<ul>
<li>bars with uncommon time signature denominators can't be converted yet (e.g. 4/6, etc.)</li>
<li>bars with beats whose duration doesn't fit a rational time signature won't be converted (e.g. a duration of 1:3)</li>
</ul>
In case a file can't be converted, the midi button will turn momentarily red, and the message "Not possible to export score - there are irregular time signatures." will appear in the Pd console.
</p>


<h2>
<a id="feature" class="anchor" href="#feature" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Feature list</h2>
<p>Here are the current list of programmed features and features to program. If any of these interest you, you can <a href="#development">commission</a> them &ndash; or any other suggestions you might have.</p>
<h4>Programmed features</h4>

<h2>
<a id="afeature" class="anchor" href="#afeature" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Advanced Features</h2>
These features are designed for Pure Data and Max/MSP programmers. You can find an example patch with the following features in <strong>examples/tutorial-subpatch-osc.pd</strong> or in <strong>Click-Tracker.maxhelp</strong>.

<h3>Setting channel output</h3>
<p>The output channels are set by default to 1 and 2. To change this setting use the command "audiooutput $1 $2 ..." or the Output Channels in the Settings window. The parameters are the output channels from 1 to 32 - as many as necessary.</p>

<h3>Click Tracker as subpatch</h3>
<p>The Click Tracker can be used as a subpatch of another Pure Data patch - it has one inlet for control messages and two outlets for sound and messages.<br>
It is useful if you add the line "subpatch" to your score: this will turn off the keyboard control, and route the sound output out of the main dac to the left outlet.</p>

<h3>OSC Controls</h3>
<p>Click on OSC to open the OSC settings window. There you can set:
<ul>
<li>Receive port - the receive port of the Click Tracker patch. The default port is 5625.</li>
<li>Send Adress / Port - IP Adress and Port where the Click Tracker is sending to. The default value is 127.0.0.1. You must activate the "connect OSC" button.</li>
<li>Debug messages on/off - turn on to see any error messages from false OSC commands. The default port is 5626.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h4>OSC Setup in the score file</h4>
You can setup the OSC parameters in your score. For that, use the following commands:
<ul>
<li>osc port $1 - set receiving port</li>
<li>osc sendip $1 - set send IP</li>
<li>osc sendport $1 - set send port</li>
</ul>

<h4>OSC Variables</h4>
<p>See the <strong>examples/tutorial-subpatch-osc.pd</strong> file for examples on all the possible variables and their arguments.</p>

<!-- <h4>Outoing variables</h4>

<h3><a id="syntax-high" class="anchor" href="#syntax-high" aria-hidden="true"></a>Inputting a score with syntax highlighting</h3>
If you use <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a> for Windows, you can install an extension to allow for syntax highligting, making your work even easier. Comments will be colored green, commands in blue, and the "b" at the start of a bar in red:
<center><img src="images/syntax-high-w.png" width="294" height="230"></center>
<p>For that, follow these steps:
<ul>
<li>Download the <a href="images/click-tracker.udl.xml">click-tracker.udl.xml</a> file.</li>
<li>In Notepad++ go to Language/User Defined Language/Open User Defined Language Folder.</li>
<li>Move the click-tracker.udl file to that folder.</li>
<li>Restart Notepad++. When you open a Click Tracker score, go to Language/Click Tracker to activate the highlighting.</li>
</ul>
