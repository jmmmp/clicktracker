<p>Click Tracker is a program designed for composers, conductors and instrumentalists working with modern music. The main goal of the software is to prepare a click track of any score, no matter how complex it is.</p>
<p>This software runs under the open source program Pure Data, and can be used either by conductors in concert, by musicians for practice purposes, by composers while composing — or just to produce and record a click track to be played back at a later point.</p>
<p>To prepare a score, just input the values in a plain text file format (.txt) according to the syntax explained in the tutorial online, or sent with the program.</p>

<a id="price-and-paypal-donations" class="anchor" href="#price-and-paypal-donations" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Price and Paypal donations</h2>
<p>This software is available here to download.</p>
<p>In order to make its continued development possible, a minimum of a <strong>one-time donation</strong> is suggested. For professional musicians I would suggest 50 EUR, for students 25 EUR - of course, you can donate more or less than that. Keep in mind that if you use this program regularly, it will save much rehearsal and learning time. And also, that for the program to reach this stage of development, many hours of work were invested into it.</p>
<p>Donations can be made with your <a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=HGULBT7P75Q4G">PAYPAL</a> account. Bank transfers to a german account are also possible (contact me for details).</p>
<p>An invoice can be written for donations.</p>

<p>The current version has been programmed in my free time, which unfortunately has run out.</p>
<p>I'm in search of any support (residencies, grants, etc.), that would allow me to dedicate more time to incorporate several features that could make this program more complete. These features include not just improvements in the existing possibilities, but also new techniques of input, control and performance, which will make it an even better learning, performance and composition tool. You can consult the list of current and planned features.</p>
<p>If you know some institution/ensemble/individual that could be interested in supporting the further development of this program - or in comissioning any specific features - please contact me. Or if you want me to program a specific feature with your ideas, I'll give you a quote.</p>
<p>Every individual or group contributing to the development of this program will be mentioned in future versions.</p>

<a id="online-score-repository" class="anchor" href="#online-score-repository" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Online score repository</h2>
<p>I'm starting to create a repository of the transcribed pieces, so that they can be put online for anyone to download. In that way everyone can see which pieces have already been transcribed, and doesn't have to repeat the work himself. If you want to send any files to me, that would be much appreciated.</p>

<a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to GitHub Pages.</h3>
<p>This automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/">using GitHub Flavored Markdown</a>, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new <code>gh-pages</code> branch locally. If you’re using GitHub Desktop, simply sync your repository and you’ll see the new branch.</p>
<h3>
<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Designer Templates</h3>
<p>We’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.</p>
<h3>
<a id="creating-pages-manually" class="anchor" href="#creating-pages-manually" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Creating pages manually</h3>
<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>
<p>You can <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/#mentioning-users-and-teams" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
