<p>Click Tracker is a program designed for composers, conductors and instrumentalists working with modern music. The main goal of the software is to prepare a click track of any score, no matter how complex it is.</p>
<p>This software runs under the open source program Pure Data, and can be used either by conductors in concert, by musicians for practice purposes, by composers while composing — or just to produce and record a click track to be played back at a later point.</p>
<p>To prepare a score, just input the values in a plain text file format (.txt) according to the syntax explained in the tutorial online, or sent with the program.</p>

<p>In order to make its continued development possible, a minimum of a <strong>one-time donation</strong> is suggested. For professional musicians I would suggest 50 EUR, for students 25 EUR - of course, you can donate more or less than that. Keep in mind that if you use this program regularly, it will save much rehearsal and learning time. And also, that for the program to reach this stage of development, many hours of work were invested into it.</p>
<p>Donations can be easily made through <a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=2XZQ9DV5MDZY6">PAYPAL</a>. Bank transfers to a german account are also possible (contact me for details).</p>
<p>An invoice can be written for donations.</p>

<p>I'm searching for any support (residencies, grants, etc.), that would allow me to dedicate more time to incorporate several features that could make this program more complete. These features include not just improvements in the existing possibilities, but also new techniques of input, control and performance, which will make it an even better learning, performance and composition tool. You can consult the list of current and planned features. XX LINK</p>
<p>If you know some institution/ensemble/individual that could be interested in supporting the further development of this program - or in comissioning any specific features - please contact me. Or if you want me to program a specific feature with your ideas, I'll give you a quote.</p>
<p>Every individual or group contributing to the development of this program will be mentioned in future versions.</p>

<a id="online-score-repository" class="anchor" href="#online-score-repository" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Online score repository</h2>
<p>I'm starting to create a repository of the transcribed pieces, so that they can be put online for anyone to download. In that way everyone can see which pieces have already been transcribed, and doesn't have to repeat the work himself. If you want to send any files to me, that would be much appreciated.</p>
