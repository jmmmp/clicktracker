The main goal of the software is to prepare a click track of any score, no matter how complex it is.\r\n\r\nThis software runs under the open source program Pure Data, and can be used either by conductors in concert, by musicians for practice purposes, by composers while composing — or just to produce and record a click track to be played back at a later point.\r\n\r\nTo prepare a score, just input the values in a plain text file format (.txt) according to the syntax explained in the tutorial online, or sent with the patch.\r\n\r\n## Price and Paypal donations\r\n\r\nThis software is available here to download.\r\n\r\nIn order to make its continued development possible, a minimum of a **one-time donation** is suggested. For professional musicians I would suggest 50 EUR, for students 25 EUR - of course, you can donate more or less than that. Keep in mind that if you use this program regularly, it will save much rehearsal and learning time. And also, that for the program to reach this stage of development, many hours of work were invested into it.\r\n\r\nDonations can be made with your [PAYPAL](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=HGULBT7P75Q4G) account. Bank transfers to a german account are also possible (contact me for details).\r\n\r\n## Download and installation\r\n\r\n[http://code.google.com/p/clicktracker/wiki/DownloadandInstallation](HERE) you can learn how to download and install the software.\r\n\r\n## Further development and commissioning of features\r\n\r\nThe current version has been programmed in my free time, which unfortunately has run out.\r\n\r\nI'm in search of any support (residencies, grants, etc.), that would allow me to dedicate more time to incorporate several features that could make this program more complete. These features include not just improvements in the existing possibilities, but also new techniques of input, control and performance, which will make it an even better learning, performance and composition tool. You can consult the list of current and planned features.\r\n\r\nIf you know some institution/ensemble/individual that could be interested in supporting the further development of this program - or in comissioning any specific features - please contact me. Or if you want me to program a specific feature with your ideas, I'll give you a quote.\r\n\r\nEvery individual or group contributing to the development of this program will be mentioned in future versions.\r\n\r\n## Online score repository\r\n\r\nI'm starting to create a repository of the transcribed pieces, so that they can be put online for anyone to download. In that way everyone can see which pieces have already been transcribed, and doesn't have to repeat the work himself. If you want to send any files to me, that would be much appreciated.\r\n\r\n## License and distribution\r\n\r\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/'>http://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc-nd/3.0/88x31.png' alt='Creative Commons License' /> Click Tracker by Joao Pais is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial No Derivs 3.0 Unported License.

Author your page content here [using GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new `gh-pages` branch locally. If you’re using GitHub Desktop, simply sync your repository and you’ll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out our [documentation](https://help.github.com/pages) or [contact support](https://github.com/contact) and we’ll help you sort it out.\r\n","google":"UA-21726670-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
