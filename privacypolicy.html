<h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
<p>This privacy policy governs your use of the software application Click Tracker (“Application”) for mobile devices that was created by João Pais. The Application is a click track designer, made for composers, instrumentalists and conductors working with modern music.</p>
<p>The Click Tracker does not retain or track any user data. App permission to record audio (android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO) is used only to export a click track into a wav file, located in the ClickTracker folder - when the user so decides on it.</p>

<h2>Changes</h2>
<p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. We will notify you of any changes to our Privacy Policy by posting the new Privacy Policy at http://jmmmp.github.io/clicktracker/privacypolicy.html. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes, as continued use is deemed approval of all changes.</p>

<h2>Your Consent</h2>
<p>By using the Application, you are consenting to our processing of your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy now and as amended by us. "Processing,” means using or touching information in any way, including, but not limited to, collecting, storing, deleting, using, combining and disclosing information, all of which activities will take place in Germany. If you reside outside Germany your information will be transferred, processed and stored there under Germany privacy standards.</p>
 
<h2>Contact us</h2>
<p>If you have any questions regarding privacy while using the Application, or have questions about our practices, please contact us via email at jmmmpais@gmail.com.</p>
